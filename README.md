## Introduction

C# is a versatile, object-oriented programming language developed by Microsoft. It is widely used for building desktop applications, web applications, and more recently, cross-platform applications using .NET Core and .NET 5+. This repository contains various projects and code examples to help you learn and improve your C# programming skills.

## Projects

Here are some of the key projects in this repository:

1. **Basic Programs**
   - Hello World
   - Data Types and Variables
   - Control Structures (if, switch, loops)
   - Functions and Methods

2. **Intermediate Programs**
   - Object-Oriented Programming (Classes, Inheritance, Polymorphism)
   - Exception Handling
   - LINQ (Language Integrated Query)

3. **Advanced Projects**
   - ASP.NET Core Web Applications
   - WPF Desktop Applications
   - Unit Testing with NUnit or MSTest

## Setup and Installation

To run the C# programs in this repository, you need to have the .NET SDK installed on your system. .NET SDK includes the necessary tools and libraries for building and running C# applications.

### Installation Steps

1. **Install .NET SDK:**
   - Download and install the .NET SDK from [dot.net](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).
   - Ensure `dotnet` command is added to your system PATH.

2. **Using an IDE:**
   - Use Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code with C# extension, or JetBrains Rider for a more integrated development environment.

## Usage

To compile and run a C# program, navigate to the directory containing the `.csproj` file (for .NET Core/5+ projects) or `.cs` file (for single-file programs) and use the following commands:

### Using .NET CLI

```sh
dotnet build
dotnet run
```

For example:

```sh
cd HelloWorld
dotnet build
dotnet run
```
